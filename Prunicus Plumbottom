Prunicus Plumbottom: 

A plum tree gone bad. Plum trees are grown in the berry garden, despite not being a berry fruit. Plum trees are the first and only non-berry fruit to be grown in the Berry Garden, in hopes to eventually grow more fruit trees in the garden. Due to the negative remarks and comments from visitors for not being a berry, the plum tree withers and turns bad.

It likes to feast on berries in Berry Garden. Unfortunately, once it touches any plant, it wilts and goes bad too. It terrorizes berries because it is not considered a berry itself, so it lashes its fury on those that are.

Perhaps more non-berry fruits should be planted in the Berry Garden so that the plum trees aren't criticized anymore. Or perhaps one shouldn't criticize things so recklessly.
