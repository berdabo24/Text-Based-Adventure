Dragon

A tyrant ruled over a kingdom of gold in another universe, living in luxury while its people suffered. Its grand palace, built from stolen riches and forced labour, was a symbol of its power. No one dared to challenge it.

One day, its most trusted human servant proposed a bold idea—expand beyond this universe. A powerful teleporter can be built to reach new worlds, promising even greater conquest. The Dragon, eager for more, entertained this seemingly grander dream. But ambition is always a double-edged sword. 

During the demonstration, something went wrong. The machine went out of control, sucking the Dragon inside. In an instant, it was hurled through outer space and crashed into an unknown world—the Potato Kingdom.

As the teleporter room's door opened, a human and a silly potato with a crown stood there.

Rage boiled inside the Dragon. Was this a mistake? Or a betrayal? It didn't matter. The Dragon had only one thought—this world would suffer for it, especially the human.
