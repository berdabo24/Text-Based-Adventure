Thief
A mischievous monkey in disguise, always on the prowl for his next 'prized' possession. Though his foolery makes him a regular visitor at the bustling markets of Potato Kingdom, no one has ever managed, or cared enough to catch him. His swift hands and clever tricks ensure that he vanishes into the crowd before anyone can react.

Instead of looting gold or treasure, simple things like fruits, vegetables or the occasional loaf of bread are his main target. Food is abundant in the kingdom, and yet, he refuses to work for it. Why? Because to him, labour is the ultimate joke. He follows a peculiar philosophy: "Why waste a lifetime earning when you can simply take?"

Despite frequent appearance in the market, no one really knows his name. He never trades nor shows his real appearance in the market, thus securing his anonymity. 

Some see him as a harmless trickster, some see him as an annoying pest. But one thing's for sure: if something's gone missing in the market, chances are, the Thief has already swung away with it.
