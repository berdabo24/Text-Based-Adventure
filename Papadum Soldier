Papadum Soldier

The Papadum Army's duty is to protect the citizens and defend the Potato Kingdom. Some of the Papadum Soldiers are also tasked with dealing with the domestic affairs of the Potato Kingdom. 

General Yahoo was the founder of the Papadum Army to establish maximum defense to ensure the Potato Kingdom is safe and the Papadum Army is ready to fight at any. Ever since the Papadum Army existed, there hasn't been a single attack from other kingdoms. Perhaps it is because the kingdom was never targeted to be attacked by anyone in the first place.

They train frequently at the public Training Grounds and would occasionally spar with citizens so that they can learn how to fight and defend too. Who knows? Maybe they can motivate each other to improve and be better. Maybe the citizens they spar with could be future Papadum Soldiers.
